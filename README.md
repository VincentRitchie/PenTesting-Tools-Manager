## Future Enhancements

1. **Integration with CI/CD Pipelines**

    Automate the execution of pentesting tools as part of the continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) process. This ensures that security testing is performed regularly and any vulnerabilities are detected early in the development lifecycle.

2. **Web-based User Interface**

    Develop a web-based interface for the pentesting tools manager to allow users to manage tools and execute tests through a browser. This can make the tool more accessible and user-friendly for team members who are not comfortable using command-line interfaces.

3. **Automated Reporting and Notifications**

    Implement features to automatically generate detailed reports of the pentesting activities and results. Additionally, add notification systems (e.g., email, Slack) to alert team members of critical findings and necessary actions in real-time, enhancing the response time and overall security posture of the company.
